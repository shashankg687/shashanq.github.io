Welcome to **Qurious Labs: Quantum Research in Information, Optimization and Unconditional Security**, an academic research group at the Centre for Quantum Computing and Department of Physics at the [Indian Institute of Technology Indore](https://iiti.ac.in/). We are dedicated to advancing the theory and practice of **quantum information, optimization, and unconditional security**, bridging fundamental research with practical quantum communication technologies.

Our Vision
======

Qurious Labs aims to:

* Develop **fundamental theory** and **practical protocols** for quantum communication and cryptography that are both theoretically sound and experimentally implementable.

* Bridge **academic research**, **industry-grade implementations**, and **national mission needs** in quantum technologies, contributing to India's quantum technology ecosystem.

* Foster a research culture that combines **rigorous mathematics**, **realistic modeling**, and **hands-on implementation** to create secure, scalable quantum networks.

* Build a **quantum-secure India** by innovating in both discrete-variable and continuous-variable quantum systems and establishing practical quantum communication infrastructure.

Research Themes
======

Qurious Labs focuses on a spectrum of interconnected research areas:

**Quantum Information & Correlations**

Investigating multipartite entanglement, Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) steering, quantum contextuality, and their fundamental role in achieving communication complexity advantages and network superiority. We explore certification methods in device-independent and semi-device-independent frameworks.

**Quantum Cryptography & Unconditional Security**

Designing, analyzing, and optimizing quantum key distribution protocols including BBM92, MDI-QKD, Twin Field QKD, DPS-QKD, and continuous-variable QKD. We conduct rigorous security analysis under realistic attack scenarios (sequential attacks, photon-number-splitting attacks, unsharp measurements) and develop countermeasures for practical quantum networks.

**Quantum Networks & Multi‑Party Computation**

Architecting quantum network topologies and protocols for secure multi-party quantum computation over heterogeneous networks. Our focus includes hub-and-spoke architectures, cellular quantum network units (such as **ChaQra**), and protocols for quantum-secure information sharing across distributed nodes.

**Continuous-Variable Quantum Systems & Simulation**

Designing and modeling continuous-variable QKD systems with emphasis on robust, experimentally realistic implementations. We develop simulation frameworks in **MATLAB/Simulink** and other platforms to bridge the gap between theory and practical deployment.

**Post‑Quantum & Hybrid Cryptography**

Exploring interfaces between quantum cryptography and post‑quantum classical schemes. We work on randomness generation, entropy expansion, quantum-safe random number generators, and hybrid security architectures that combine quantum and classical protection.

**Optimization in Quantum Protocols**

Optimizing resource efficiency across all stages of quantum protocols—from reconciliation and error correction to distillation and parameter estimation—to achieve high key rates and robustness over realistic noisy channels.

What We Do
======

**Research Projects**

We undertake fundamental and applied research projects supported by national agencies and industry partners, including:

* Long-distance quantum key distribution systems (150+ km demonstrations)
* Quantum network architecture design and optimization
* Novel quantum cryptographic primitives and security protocols
* Quantum random number generation and entropy expansion
* Device-independent and semi-device-independent quantum communication

**Student Mentoring & Training**

We supervise **B.Tech project students**, **M.Sc. thesis students**, and **Ph.D. researchers** on topics spanning quantum information theory, protocol design, simulation, and experimental modeling. We also mentor students through structured internship programs and short research projects.

**Collaborations**

We actively collaborate with leading academic institutions, national laboratories, and quantum technology companies to advance the frontiers of quantum communication and ensure our research has real-world impact.

<!-- **Workshops & Outreach**

We organize thematic workshops, invited talks, and training programs on quantum information, quantum cryptography, and post‑quantum security to strengthen the local and national quantum research ecosystem and engage with the broader scientific community.
