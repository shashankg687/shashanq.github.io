Welcome to my web address! I am an Assistant Professor at the [Interdisciplinary Areas (Quantum Computing)](https://iiti.ac.in/) and Department of Physics at the [Indian Institute of Technology Indore](https://iiti.ac.in/), where I lead Qurious group (Quantum Research in Information, Optimization and Unconditional Security).

Research Focus
======
My research sits at the intersection of quantum foundations and practical quantum technologies. I work on:

* **Quantum Cryptography & Key Distribution**: Developing secure quantum communication protocols including MDI-QKD, Twin Field QKD, and BBM92 protocols. My work at QNu Labs helped break distance barriers in quantum key distribution (150 Km Point-to-Point and ChaQra configuration for Point-to-Multipoint).

* **Multipartite Quantum Resources**: Exploring the foundations and applications of multipartite entanglement, quantum steering, and their certification in device-independent scenarios.

* **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Investigating cryptographic solutions for the post-quantum era, including hybrid quantum-classical security frameworks.

* **Quantum Network Architecture**: Designing quantum network topologies and protocols for multi-party quantum computation, with a vision toward establishing a quantum-secure Indian subcontinent.

My approach combines rigorous theoretical foundations with practical implementation, bridging fundamental quantum information theory with commercial quantum technologies.

Academic Journey
======
I completed my Integrated Ph.D. in Quantum Information Theory (2015-2021) from [S. N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences](http://www.bose.res.in/), Kolkata, where my dissertation focused on "Certification and Preservation of Quantum Correlations." Following my Ph.D., I gained unique industry experience as a Senior Research Associate at [QNu Labs](https://www.qnulabs.com/) (2021-2023), an Indian quantum cryptography startup, where I contributed to developing novel quantum-safe solutions.

I then pursued postdoctoral research at the [Applied Cryptography Unit](https://groups.oist.jp/acu) at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST), Japan (2023-2024), working with Prof. Carlos Cid on advanced quantum distillation protocols. I returned to QNu Labs as Research Lead (2024-2025) before joining IIT Indore in November 2025.

Recent Highlights
======
* **15+ publications** in prestigious journals including *Physical Review Letters*, *Physical Review A*, and *Quantum Information Processing*
* **4 granted patents** with 6 more under examination in quantum key distribution and quantum cryptography
* Presented research at **QIP 2024** (Taipei), **SPIE Optics + Photonics 2024** (San Diego), and **Quantum Innovation 2024** (Tokyo)
* Developed **ChaQra** - a cellular quantum network unit designed for the Indian quantum network infrastructure
* Led projects funded by Ministry of Defense (₹3 Crores) and National Cyber Security Council (₹5.25 Crores)

Beyond Research
======
When not exploring quantum correlations, I enjoy analyzing financial markets, sketching, and solving complex puzzles. I'm passionate about mentoring the next generation of quantum scientists and have supervised numerous undergraduate and graduate students through SPARQ internships and QIntern programs.

I believe in building bridges between quantum theory and practical applications, contributing to India's emergence as a quantum technology leader while advancing our fundamental understanding of quantum information.

Current Opportunities
======
I am looking for motivated **Ph.D. students** and **postdoctoral researchers** to join my research group at IIT Indore. If you're interested in quantum communication, quantum cryptography, or quantum network architecture, please feel free to reach out!
