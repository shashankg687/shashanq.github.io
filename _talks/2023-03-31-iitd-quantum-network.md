<!-- **Abstract** -->

This seminar establishes the fundamental connection between quantum contextuality, communication complexity advantages, and secure quantum networks. We show how contextual quantum correlations can be harnessed to achieve network security properties impossible classically.

**Key Topics**
- Quantum contextuality fundamentals
- Communication complexity and advantages
- Network security applications
- Device-independent security certification
- Practical network implications

**Venue:** Center for Quantum Technologies, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi
