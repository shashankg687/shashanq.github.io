<!-- **Abstract** -->

Poster presentation on novel distillation protocols for genuine tripartite EPR steering from mixed quantum states. This work demonstrates methods to enhance steering in degraded quantum systems.

**Key Topics**
- Tripartite steering distillation
- Mixed state preparation
- Experimental feasibility

This work was later published in *Physical Review A* 104, 022409 (2021).
