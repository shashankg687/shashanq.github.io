**Abstract**

This lecture explores emerging applications of quantum machine learning for detecting AI-generated deepfake content. We discuss quantum algorithms for feature extraction and classification, and their potential advantages over classical approaches for security applications in healthcare.

**Key Topics**
- Deepfake detection challenges
- Quantum machine learning fundamentals
- Quantum classifiers and detection algorithms
- Healthcare security implications

**Context:** Part of an ATAL (Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration) sponsored faculty development program on quantum AI applications in healthcare.
