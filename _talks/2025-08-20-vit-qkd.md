**Abstract**

This comprehensive lecture demystifies quantum key distribution for faculty members and researchers new to quantum cryptography. We cover fundamental principles, practical protocols (BB84, BBM92, MDI-QKD, CV-QKD), security proofs, and real-world implementations.

**Key Topics**
- Quantum key distribution principles
- Major QKD protocols and their properties
- Security analysis and proofs
- Practical implementations and commercial systems
- Integration with existing infrastructure

**Audience:** Faculty members and researchers across engineering and physics departments
