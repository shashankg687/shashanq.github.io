<!-- **Abstract** -->

This talk explores the intersection of quantum contextuality and device-independent quantum information, with particular focus on building secure quantum networks that don't require full device characterization. We demonstrate how contextual correlations can be certified and utilized for secure communication.

**Key Topics**
- Contextuality in quantum mechanics
- Semi-device-independent frameworks
- Network security implications
- Practical certification methods

**Audience:** Young researchers in quantum information science across India
