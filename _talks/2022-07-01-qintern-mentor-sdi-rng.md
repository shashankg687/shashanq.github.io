**Abstract**

As a mentor in QWorld's QIntern program, I guided an undergraduate student through a research project on semi-device-independent (SDI) approaches to continuous-variable quantum random number generation (QRNG). The project explored practical methods to certify randomness without assuming full device characterization.

**Project Highlights**
- SDI security framework introduction
- Continuous-variable quantum systems
- Randomness certification protocols
- Practical implementation and simulation

**Mentee Project:** "Continuous Variable Quantum Random Number Generators - SDI-CVQRNG"

**Significance:** Part of QWorld's effort to train the next generation of quantum information scientists globally.
