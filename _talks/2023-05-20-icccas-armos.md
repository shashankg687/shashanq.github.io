<!-- **Abstract** -->

ARMOS 2.0 is a production-grade quantum key distribution system developed at QuNu Labs with robust countermeasures against photon-number-splitting (PNS) attacks. This presentation describes the system architecture, security features, and practical deployment experience from real-world quantum communication deployments.

**Key Topics**
- Photon-number-splitting attacks and defenses
- Commercial QKD system design
- Security validation and testing
- Practical deployment considerations
- Achieving 150+ km point-to-point QKD

**Team:** Developed collaboratively with Rajesh Kumar Krishnan, Vijayalaxmi Mogiligidda, Roopak T, Manasa Hegde, Sairam Rajamani, and Dilip Singh.

**Innovation Recognition:** This work received the Innovation Award from QuNu Labs (2023).
