**Abstract**

This lecture provides an overview of post-quantum cryptography—the landscape of cryptographic algorithms designed to resist attacks from both classical and quantum computers. We discuss NIST standards, hybrid approaches, and the transition to quantum-safe infrastructure.

**Key Topics**
- Quantum threat to classical cryptography
- Post-quantum cryptographic algorithms (lattice-based, hash-based, multivariate)
- NIST standardization process
- Hybrid quantum-classical approaches
- Migration strategy for organizations

**Format:** One-week intensive program for college faculty members
