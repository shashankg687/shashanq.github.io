**Abstract**

Poster presentation at the premier TQC conference, presenting the counterintuitive result that non-Markovian memory effects in quantum channels can constructively enhance quantum resources.

**Key Topics**
- Non-Markovian dynamics
- Resource enhancement
- Quantum channel memory effects
- Network applications
