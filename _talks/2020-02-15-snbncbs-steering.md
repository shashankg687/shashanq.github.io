<!-- **Abstract** -->

Internal presentation at my doctoral institution demonstrating the power of sharp logical contradictions in proving tripartite quantum steering. A novel all-versus-nothing proof of genuine tripartite steering using deterministic correlations.

**Key Topics**
- All-versus-nothing steering proofs
- Logical contradictions in quantum mechanics
- Multipartite steering fundamentals

**Venue:** PhD Dissertation Research Presentation Series
