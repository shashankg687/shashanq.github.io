**Abstract**

This lecture presents novel eavesdropping strategies against quantum key distribution networks using sequential unsharp measurements. We discuss how eavesdroppers can exploit measurement imprecision and quantum mechanics to extract secret information, and propose countermeasures.

**Key Topics**
- QKD security models and threat models
- Unsharp measurement attacks
- Sequential measurement strategies
- Network-level vulnerabilities
- Defense mechanisms

**Context:** Part of QWorld's Qcourse 511 online educational program on quantum information processing

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Understanding attack vectors in practical QKD systems
- Security validation methodologies
- Implications for real-world deployments
