**Abstract**

ChaQra represents a cellular quantum network architecture designed for the Indian quantum network infrastructure. This presentation outlines the design philosophy, technical specifications, and deployment roadmap for establishing secure, scalable quantum communication networks across India. We discuss how ChaQra units can be interconnected to form a unified quantum-secure Indian subcontinent.

**Key Topics**
- Cellular quantum network architecture
- ChaQra unit design and specifications
- Integration with existing telecommunications infrastructure
- Roadmap for Indian quantum network deployment

This work was developed as part of our vision to establish a quantum-secure communication infrastructure for India.
