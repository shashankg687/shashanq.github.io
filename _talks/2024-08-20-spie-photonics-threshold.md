**Abstract**

This presentation introduces the Threshold (Q, P) Quantum Distillation protocol at one of the world's largest optics and photonics conferences. The protocol leverages threshold measurements on quantum states to achieve resource-efficient quantum state distillation, with significant implications for practical quantum communication systems and quantum information processing.

**Key Topics**
- Quantum state distillation techniques
- Threshold measurement strategies
- Integration with quantum photonic systems
- Path to practical implementation

**Significance:** Selected for presentation at a premier international conference on optics and photonics technology.
