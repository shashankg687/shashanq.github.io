<!-- **Abstract** -->

This presentation demonstrates the fundamental connection between quantum contextuality and communication complexity, establishing that contextual correlations can be exploited to achieve communication advantages impossible classically. This result has profound implications for quantum networks and quantum information theory.

**Key Topics**
- Quantum contextuality fundamentals
- Communication complexity theory
- Contextuality-assisted communication protocols
- Implications for quantum network design

**Publication:** This work was published in *Physical Review Letters* 130, 080802 (2023).

**Significance:** QIP is the premier international conference on quantum information processing.
