## Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Japan

**Duration:** November 2023 - November 2024  
**Affiliation:** Applied Cryptography Unit, Complexity Sciences Unit  
**Mentor:** Prof. Carlos Cid

### Overview

OIST is a world-class international research institute in Okinawa, Japan, dedicated to advancing science and technology through multidisciplinary research. My postdoctoral appointment at OIST provided an opportunity to conduct cutting-edge research on advanced quantum cryptography and distillation protocols in a globally competitive environment.

### Research Focus

During my postdoctoral tenure, I conducted research on:

- **Quantum Distillation Protocols**: Developed novel threshold-based quantum distillation techniques optimizing resource efficiency
- **Device-Independent Quantum Communication**: Advanced security proofs under non-Markovian channel effects
- **Quantum Network Security**: Analysis of sequential attacks in device-independent QKD scenarios
- **Post-Quantum Cryptographic Interfaces**: Hybrid approaches combining quantum and classical security
