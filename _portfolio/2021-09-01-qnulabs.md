## QuNu Labs Pvt. Ltd., Bengaluru

**Duration:** September 2021 - Present  
**Roles:** Senior Research Associate (2021-2023), Research Lead (2024-2025), Innovation & Academy Consultant (2025-Present)

### Overview

QuNu Labs is India's leading quantum cryptography startup, pioneering quantum key distribution (QKD) technology and quantum-safe solutions. Founded with the mission to create a "quantum-secure India," QuNu Labs bridges the gap between academic quantum information research and practical, deployable quantum communication systems.

### Research & Innovation Focus

At QuNu Labs, I have led research and development in:

- **Quantum Key Distribution Systems**: Designed and optimized commercial QKD products achieving 150+ km point-to-point secure quantum communication
- **Attack Detection & Security**: Developed robust countermeasures against photon-number-splitting (PNS) and sequential measurement attacks
- **Continuous-Variable QKD**: Advanced simulation and real-world implementation of CV-QKD systems using MATLAB and Simulink
- **Quantum Random Number Generation**: Optimized QRNG systems and entropy expansion protocols
- **ChaQra Network Architecture**: Designed cellular quantum network units for point-to-multipoint quantum communication

### Key Products & Achievements

**ARMOS 2.0 - Ultra-Secure QKD System**
- Production-grade QKD system with advanced PNS attack countermeasures
- Presented at ICCCAS 2023 (Singapore) - *"ARMOS 2.0: An ultra-secure commercial QKD product against PNS attacks"*
- Innovation Award recipient (2023)

**ChaQra - Indian Quantum Network Unit**
