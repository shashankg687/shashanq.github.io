## Harish-Chandra Research Institute, Prayagraj

**Duration:** Ongoing Research Collaboration (2023-Present)  
**Primary Collaborator:** Prof. Aditi Sen (De), Physics Division

### Overview

HRI is a premier research institution in India dedicated to fundamental research in mathematics, physics, and related areas. Through my collaboration with Prof. Aditi Sen (De) and her research group, I have engaged in advanced research on quantum resource theory and non-Markovian quantum dynamics.

### Research Collaboration

**Joint Research Areas:**

1. **Non-Markovian Effects in Quantum Resources**
   - Investigating constructive feedback of non-Markovian dynamics on quantum correlations
   - Exploring channel memory effects in quantum communication

2. **Quantum Resource Theory**
   - Resource quantification and optimization
   - Applications to quantum networks and communication

3. **Quantum Information Processing**
   - Entanglement and steering in noisy environments
   - Quantum simulation and practical implementations
